# JS-Advanced-JavaScript
You will learn how to write JavaScript in a professional environment using the new 
JavaScript syntax in ES6, how to leverage JavaScript's asynchronous nature using 
callbacks and promises, and how to set up test suites and test your code. You will 
be introduced to JavaScript's functional programming style and you will apply 
everything you learn to build a simple application in various JavaScript frameworks 
and libraries for backend and frontend development

## Advanced JavaScript - Covering Scope, Variables, Arrow Functions, Classes &amp; Modules, Transpilation, Iterators &amp; Generators
